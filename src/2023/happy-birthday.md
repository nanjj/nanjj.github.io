Richard M Stallman回：

```
[[[ To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider    ]]]
[[[ whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies,     ]]]

I'm glad to have fought for software freedom, and I'm still doing it.

Would you be willing to do some volunteer work to help the GNU Project
and/or the free software movement?

Do you see anything there you would like to do?

你愿意为GPU项目自由软件运动做些事吗？

在https://gnu.org/help 有你所需。你在那看到有你想做的吗？
